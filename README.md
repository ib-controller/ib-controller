IBController provides hands-free operation of
[Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com)
[Trader Workstation](http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/pagemap/pagemap_APISolutions.php).
It's especially useful for developers of automated trading systems who use
[IB API](http://interactivebrokers.github.io). Features include:

* Automates Trader Workstation (TWS) and IB Gateway (excluding the FIX mode)
* Completes login dialog with credentials from an ``.ini`` file or command line
* Handles dialog boxes which TWS presents during programmatic trading activities
* Offers simple encryption of IB passwords if desired
* Keeps TWS running indefinitely by handling TWS time-based exits
* Allows TWS to be terminated at a specified time on a specified day of the week
* Dismisses various dialog messages (eg version updates, daily tips, IB API
  connections etc)
* Exposes a [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) control protocol to
  ``STOP`` the GUI or ``ENABLEAPI`` for IB API client access
