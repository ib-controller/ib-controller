The files in this folder are the command files for launching IBController for use with versions of TWS earlier than TWS 952. They are provided to enable users with older versions of TWS to benefit from use of IBCOntroller.

If you are using a version of TWS from TWS 952 onwards, these files will no longer work correctly.

Note that the current version of IBController.jar will work correctly with TWS 952 and later versions. 

Also included here is the User Guide relevant to the earlier versions.
