1.	OVERVIEW
=====================
IBControllerService is a Windows Service that starts/stops IBController. 
It is a simple implementation, it simply launches the IBController batch
file. When the service is stopped it sends IBController a STOP then EXIT
command via TCPIP.

The service runs as a background process. IBController and TWS/Gateway
are not displayed on the screen, nor do they require a logged on user.
TWS can be accessed from the API client via the IP and Port configured
in TWS.

This service requires IBController to be previously installed and configured.
Make sure you can run IBController from a batch file before using this
service.
